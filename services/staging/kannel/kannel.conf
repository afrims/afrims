# CONFIGURATION FOR USING SMS KANNEL WITH RAPIDSMS
#
# For any modifications to this file, see Kannel User Guide 
# If that does not help, see Kannel web page (http://www.kannel.org) and
# various online help and mailing list archives
#
# Notes on those who base their configuration on this:
#  1) check security issues! (allowed IPs, passwords and ports)
#  2) groups cannot have empty rows inside them!
#  3) read the user guide

#---------------------------------------------
# CORE
#
# There is only one core group and it sets all basic settings
# of the bearerbox (and system). You should take extra notes on
# configuration variables like 'store-file' (or 'store-dir'),
# 'admin-allow-ip' and 'access.log'


group = core
admin-port = 13000

#---------------------------------------------
# SMSC CONNECTIONS
#
# SMSC connections are created in bearerbox and they handle SMSC specific
# protocol and message relying. You need these to actually receive and send
# messages to handset, but can use GSM modems as virtual SMSCs


# This is a fake smsc connection, _only_ used to test the system and services.
# It really cannot relay messages to actual handsets!

#group = smsc
#smsc = fake
#smsc-id = FAKE

#---------------------------------------------
# SMSBOX SETUP
#
# Smsbox(es) do higher-level SMS handling after they have been received from
# SMS centers by bearerbox, or before they are given to bearerbox for delivery

# SEND-SMS USERS
#
# These users are used when Kannel smsbox sendsms interface is used to
# send PUSH sms messages, i.e. calling URL like
# http://kannel.machine:13013/cgi-bin/sendsms?username=tester&password=foobar...

# This is the username and password that RapidSMS uses to deliver SMSes to
# Kannel.  It must also set the 'smsc' variable in the query string, so that
# Kannel knows which SMSC to use to route the message.

username = rapidsms
password = CHANGE ME
user-deny-ip = "*.*.*.*"
user-allow-ip = "127.0.0.1;98.101.157.89;173.203.221.48;"

#---------------------------------------------
# SERVICES
#
# These are 'responses' to sms PULL messages, i.e. messages arriving from
# handsets. The response is based on message content. Only one sms-service is
# applied, using the first one to match.

# The 'ping-kannel' service let's you check to see if Kannel is running,
# even if RapidSMS is offline for some reason.

group = sms-service
keyword = ping-kannel
text = "Kannel is online and responding to messages."

# There should be always a 'default' service. This service is used when no
# other 'sms-service' is applied.  These relay incoming messages from Zain
# and TNM, respectively, to the appropriate HTTP backend URLs in RapidSMS.
# By setting 'accepted-smsc', we are assured that messages are routed to
# the appropriate backend in RapidSMS.

group = sms-service
keyword = default
accepted-smsc = usb0-modem
# don't send a reply here (it'll come through sendsms):
